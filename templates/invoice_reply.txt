Dear user,

Thanks for your reply.

The refund operation time of the Play Store is at least 2 ~ 3 days. Please wait patiently after completing the following steps. 

If you want to turn off auto-updates and unsubscribe from the store, in order to prevent accidentally wrong orders, please visit the link: https://support.google.com/googleplay/workflow/9827184?sjid=1921449151148107108-AP&visit_id=638563450790959167-2658423183&p=cancelsubsawf&rd=1&hl=en

Because all the application payment processes are through the Play Store, we are not authorized to directly cancel your subscription and refund you. This is due to the payment and personal policy on the Play Store. We are sincerely sorry for the inconvenience.
Thank you for your patience and understanding. Please stay with us and we will try hard to improve.

Sincerely,
PhotoGrid Team
